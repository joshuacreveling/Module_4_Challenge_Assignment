# Module 4 Challenge Assignment - Analyzing Portfolio Risk and Return

---
## Description

In this challenge, we assume the role of a quantitative analyst aiming to evaluate new investment options for inclusion into client's portfolios.  In this excercise, four funds as well as the S&P 500 are analyzed over the timeframe 2014-10-01 through 2020-09-11.  The four funds analyzed include: Soros Fund Management LLC, Paulson & Co Inc, Tiger Global Management LLC and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  The DataSet, ```whale_navs.csv```, is located in the Resources folder in the project repository.

By analyzing the key risk-managment metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe Ratios, and betas, we will recommend one of the funds to be included into the firm's suite of fund offerings. 

The sections in the JupyterLab notebook include: 

1. Import the Data

2. Analyze the Performance

3. Analyze the Volatility

4. Analyze the Risk

5. Analyze the Risk-Return Profile
